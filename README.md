Discord implementation of https://github.com/dreignier/cgbot-core 
# How to use
1. Compile main.cpp to a folder named 'ai'
2. Place training data with the filename 'text.txt'. Make sure to put '<<EOF>>' at the end of the training data file.
3. Remove server specific code I've left over in the index.js file because I'm lazy
4. Enjoy... I guess..
